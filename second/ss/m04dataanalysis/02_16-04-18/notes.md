## Variability of Data
###### Variability in measurements against the true value
- the mean should be close to the true value, but precision is based on the variability of the data. This is done either by
  1. summarizing the statistics.
    * Measuring location
      * mean
      * median
      * mode
    * Measuring spread
      * range
      * variance
      * standard deviation
  2. visualization by graphs

### Measures of location
1. Mean : average. Sensitive to outlier data that hold data that is far away from average.

2. Median : middle value (50th-percentile.)

3. Mode : Value with highest frequency

These are all the same if the measurements have symmetric distribution


### Measures of spread
1. Range: differnece between the max and min

2. Variance:

3. Standard deviation: most common measure of statistical dispersion which can be directly compared with mean

### Sampling
As investigating the whole population is not realistic in most cases, sampling is needed to get the most educated hypothesis out of the data given.

Sampling for the internet includes:
* observation points
* time, duration
* packet flow with IP addresses and user IDs

#### Sampling methods

1. Deterministic 1/N Sampling
  * possible synchronization with targets of measurement
2. Probablistic 1/N Sampling
  * probablistically select packets
3. Sampling by time
4. Flow-based Sampling
